Daily Quote Generator

The Daily Quote Generator is a simple yet impactful web project designed to provide users with motivational and inspirational quotes at the click of a button. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this lightweight application demonstrates core front-end development skills while delivering a clean and engaging user experience.
The primary functionality of the application is to display a randomly selected quote from a predefined list every time the user clicks the “New Quote” button. The quotes are stored in a JavaScript array, and each click triggers a function that randomly selects and displays one of them in the interface. This dynamic behavior introduces users to basic JavaScript logic, DOM manipulation, and event handling.
Styling is handled with CSS, giving the app a modern and responsive look. The layout features a centered container with subtle shadows, rounded corners, and a smooth button hover effect to enhance visual appeal. The design focuses on readability and simplicity, making the interface accessible and user-friendly across different screen sizes.This project serves as a great example of how to combine essential web technologies to create an interactive and visually appealing tool. It can be expanded in various ways, such as by fetching quotes from a public API, adding quote sharing options, or implementing dark mode support.
The Daily Quote Generator is ideal for showcasing foundational front-end skills. It emphasizes clarity in code structure, user interaction, and aesthetic design.
